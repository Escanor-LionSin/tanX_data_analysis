# Online Store Revenue Analysis

Submission for tanX task

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the main logic for reading the CSV file and computing revenue metrics.
- `test_main.py`: Contains unit tests for the revenue calculation functions.
- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the application.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the services for running the task and tests.

## Running the Application

1. Make sure you have your own copy of (if any) `orders.csv` file in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file, which is the outermost directory.

2. Clone the repo into a local directory

3. To run the main task:

```
docker-compose run task
```

4. To run the tests:

```
docker-compose run test
```
If you want to run the task on a different dataset, then replace the orders.csv file with a dataset file of your choice.
